## This converter requires a version of makerom, which can be found (here)[https://github.com/3DSGuy/Project_CTR/releases/latest/]. 

This converter only works on Windows at the moment.

Upon downloading makerom, create a dedicated folder for ``makerom.exe`` and ``Converter.bat``, and move ``makerom.exe`` and ``Converter.bat`` to that folder.

Drag your CIA to ``Converter.bat`` and you are good!
